Current state:
- The plugin is loaded by the analysis server

TODO:
- avoid to use the method computeNode(). To think about where to store the security information at the Element level.
- [Done] Separate analysis in different phases (e.g. detection of sec-syntactic errors, unsupported features, semantic checks)
- [Partially done] Design how to exclude some files from the analysis
    - e.g. test files
- [Done] Design how to recognize custom settings from the analysis_options.yaml file.
- Implements secdartanalyzer: a console application that uses the security analysis.
    
Next extensions:
- Extend the security analysis to object and classes
- Manage interaction with libraries
- Implement code transformer to insert necesary casts
