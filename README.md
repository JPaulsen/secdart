# SecDart
SecDart is an ongoing implementation of gradual security typing for Dart.

## Installation
We will provide three ways to interact with the SecDart's security analysis (currently just the first one is available!):
- **Using the online SecDart Pad** at [https://pleiad.cl/secdart/](https://pleiad.cl/secdart/)
- **The SecDart Analyzer CLI**
- **The SecDart Plugin for the Dart Analysis Server.**



## Documentation
The current implementation and documentation are admittedly limited. However
any update will be placed at [https://pleiad.cl/research/software/secdart](https://pleiad.cl/research/software/secdart).
